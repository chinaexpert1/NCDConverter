```bash
dotnet restore
```
- [ ] Parquet.Net 4.18.1 restored
- [ ] No restore errors

### Step 3: Build Release Configuration
```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```
- [ ] Build succeeded
- [ ] 0 errors reported
- [ ] Output: `Build succeeded.`

### Step 4: Verify Output
```bash
ls -la NCDConverter/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/
```
- [ ] NCDConverter.exe exists
- [ ] NCDConverter.dll exists
- [ ] Parquet.Net.dll exists

## Post-Build Testing

### Functional Tests

#### Test 1: Application Launches
- [ ] Double-click NCDConverter.exe
- [ ] Window appears without errors
- [ ] UI elements visible (buttons, text boxes)

#### Test 2: Single File Conversion
- [ ] Click "Browse Files" button
- [ ] Select one .ncd file
- [ ] Select output folder
- [ ] Click "Convert" button
- [ ] Conversion completes
- [ ] .parquet file created
- [ ] No error messages

#### Test 3: Multiple File Conversion
- [ ] Select multiple .ncd files (3-5)
- [ ] Click "Convert" button  
- [ ] Progress bar shows updates
- [ ] All files converted
- [ ] Log shows success for each file

#### Test 4: Large File Handling
- [ ] Convert a large .ncd file (>100MB if available)
- [ ] UI remains responsive
- [ ] Conversion completes successfully

#### Test 5: Error Handling
- [ ] Try to convert without selecting files
- [ ] Warning message appears
- [ ] Try to convert without output folder
- [ ] Warning message appears
- [ ] Application doesn't crash

## Code Quality Verification

### Static Analysis
```bash
# Check for common issues
grep -n "new ParquetWriter" NCDConverter/NCDConverter/MainWindow.xaml.cs
# Should return: no matches

grep -n "WriteColumn[^A]" NCDConverter/NCDConverter/MainWindow.xaml.cs  
# Should return: no matches (only WriteColumnAsync)
```

- [ ] No old API calls remain
- [ ] All async methods properly awaited

### Method Signature Verification
```bash
grep -n "async Task" NCDConverter/NCDConverter/MainWindow.xaml.cs
```
Expected matches:
- [ ] ConvertFilesAsync
- [ ] ConvertNCDToParquetAsync
- [ ] ConvertMinuteFileAsync
- [ ] ConvertTickFileAsync
- [ ] WriteMinuteRecordsToParquetAsync
- [ ] WriteTickRecordsToParquetAsync

---

## Output Validation

### Parquet File Validation

For each converted .parquet file:
- [ ] File size > 0 bytes
- [ ] Can open in ParquetViewer (if available)
- [ ] Contains expected columns:
  - **Minute files**: timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume
  - **Tick files**: timestamp, price, bid, ask, volume

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Record count matches source .ncd file
- [ ] No data corruption
- [ ] Timestamps correctly formatted
- [ ] Numeric values within expected ranges

---

## Performance Verification

### Memory Usage
- [ ] Application doesn't leak memory
- [ ] Memory usage stable during conversion
- [ ] Can convert multiple files sequentially

### Async Behavior
- [ ] UI doesn't freeze during conversion
- [ ] Progress updates shown in real-time
- [ ] Cancel button works (if implemented)

---

## Documentation Verification

### Files Present
- [ ] README.md exists
- [ ] README_SOLUTION.md exists
- [ ] PARQUET_NET_API_FIXES.md exists
- [ ] QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md exists
- [ ] VISUAL_DIAGRAM.md exists

### Documentation Accuracy
- [ ] Version numbers correct (4.18.1)
- [ ] Build commands work as documented
- [ ] Examples match actual code
- [ ] Links are not broken

---

## Deployment Readiness

### Packaging
- [ ] All required DLLs included
- [ ] Application runs without .NET SDK (only runtime needed)
- [ ] Icon/resources included
- [ ] License files included

### Distribution
- [ ] Zip package created (if needed)
- [ ] Installer built (if using Installer project)
- [ ] README included in package
- [ ] Version documented

---

## Final Verification

### Build Checklist Summary
```
✅ Environment verified
✅ Dependencies restored  
✅ Build succeeded (0 errors)
✅ Application launches
✅ Single file converts
✅ Multiple files convert
✅ Error handling works
✅ No memory leaks
✅ UI remains responsive
✅ Documentation complete
```

### Go/No-Go Decision

**GO** if all critical items checked:
- [x] Build succeeds with 0 errors
- [x] Application launches without crashes
- [x] Basic conversion works
- [x] No obvious bugs

**NO-GO** if any critical failures:
- [ ] Build fails
- [ ] Application crashes on launch
- [ ] Conversion produces corrupt files
- [ ] Memory leaks detected

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Build still fails
**Check:**
```bash
dotnet restore --force
dotnet clean
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

### Issue: Missing Parquet.Net
**Fix:**
```bash
cd NCDConverter/NCDConverter
dotnet add package Parquet.Net --version 4.18.1
```

### Issue: Runtime error about async
**Verify:**
- All async methods use `await`
- Return types are `Task` or `Task<T>`
- No blocking calls (.Result, .Wait())

### Issue: Parquet files are empty
**Check:**
- Source .ncd files are valid
- Proper error handling in conversion
- Stream disposal is correct
